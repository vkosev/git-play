Pull Request with the "Merge Commit" option
    - Adds all new commits from "develop" into "main". Thesese commits are with the same hash in "develop and "main"
    - Writes additional commit containing all the changes and asks you to name it
    - Merging "main" into "develop, will only add the extra merge commit
        - from branch develop running "git pull origin main" will only add 

Pull Request with "Sqash Commit" option
    - Squash all commits into one single one
    - Asks you to name the squashed commit
    - merging main into develop will add the squashed commit with the same hash 
    - from branch develop "git pull origin main" will create an additional merge commit

Good GIT Strategy could be:
    - Always add tags on the main branch
    - Merge develop into main using the "Merge Commit" option
    - After merging into main, merge the extra commit from main into develop
    - When project is of multiple people, merge peoples branches into develop using the "Squash Commit" option
    - Never use rebase option if you plan to merge the same branch into main multiple times!

This strategy will create clean commit history in main and develop branch, with extra merge commit only when making a release, because on releases we have to merge develop into main
